This small project is an experiment with React Suspense data fetching - still an experimental feature, following along [Brad Traversy's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTDJ-NQ32_E)

1. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command to install the experimental versions of React and React-DOM.
2. Run the Client using the `npm start` command.
3. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
4. You'll be able to see a spinner while it is fetching the data. If this is going too fast, you can slow it down via selection a slower speed on the Network tab of DevTools.
